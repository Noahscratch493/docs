### 🎯 Why I Made It

Scrooch was made as a fun, powerful alternative to my earlier tool, **EditableScratch**, which just rebranded the Scratch site.  
Scrooch offers:

- Mostly No use of official Scratch branding
- A custom default project ready to mod  
- A focus on creativity, editing, and conversion

#### 🧠 Scratch 2 Editor

The embedded editor was made by me — it's my own custom-built version called **Scratch 2 Legacy**:

#### 🔁 SB2 to SWF Converter

The `.sb2` to `.swf` conversion tool is based on the open-source converter by **AsentientBot**:
